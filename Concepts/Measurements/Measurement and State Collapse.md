When we measure an observable  on a quantum state |ψ⟩:
- Before Measurement, the state is a superposition: $|\psi\rangle = \sum_n c_n|a_n\rangle$, where |aₙ⟩ are eigenstates of Â with eigenvalues aₙ.
- During measurement, we get one of the eigenvalues aₙ. Probabilistic: P(aₙ) = |cₙ|² = |⟨aₙ|ψ⟩|²
- After measurement, the state collapses to the measured eigenstate: $|\psi\rangle \xrightarrow[\text{measure } a_n]{} |a_n\rangle$
