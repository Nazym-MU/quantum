For Hermitian operators Â, B̂ satisfying \[$\hat{A}$, $\hat{B}$\] = iĈ where Ĉ is Hermitian:

$$\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{|\langle C \rangle|}{2}$$
## Physical Meaning
Non-commuting observables cannot be simultaneously determined with arbitrary precision. The commutator quantifies this fundamental limitation.
## Key Insight
This is **not** about measurement disturbance. It's about the quantum state itself - no state exists where both observables have definite values.
