**Definition:** Hermitian operator representing the total energy of a quantum system. Generates time translations.
## Properties
- **Hermitian**: Ĥ† = Ĥ (ensures real energy eigenvalues)
- **Energy operator**: Eigenvalues are possible energy measurements
- **Generator of time evolution**: Appears in exponent of Û(t) = e^(-iĤt/ℏ)
- **Dimensions**: Energy (or ℏ/time)
## When Time-Independent
If Ĥ doesn't explicitly depend on time (∂Ĥ/∂t = 0):
- Commutes with time evolution operator: [Ĥ,Û] = 0
- Energy expectation value is conserved: d⟨Ĥ⟩/dt = 0
- Can write Û(t) = e^(-iĤt/ℏ) as simple exponential
## Energy Eigenstates
$$\hat{H}\ket{E_n} = E_n\ket{E_n}$$
- Eigenstates are [[Stationary States]]
- Eigenvalues E_n are measurable energies
