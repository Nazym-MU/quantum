## Definition
The probability that a particle incident on a potential is reflected back rather than transmitted through.

## Mathematical Definition
$$R = \frac{|j_{\text{ref}}|}{j_{\text{inc}}}$$

where:
- j_inc: incident [[Probability Current]]
- j_ref: magnitude of reflected probability current
## For Plane Waves
If incident wave has amplitude A and reflected wave has amplitude B:
$$R = \frac{|B|^2}{|A|^2}$$

## Probability Conservation
Must satisfy: R + T = 1, where T is the [[Transmission Coefficient]].

This ensures total probability is conserved in scattering.

## Examples

### Potential Step (E > V₀)
$$R = \left(\frac{k - k_0}{k + k_0}\right)^2$$
where k = √(2mE)/ℏ and k₀ = √(2m(E-V₀))/ℏ.

Classically R = 0 (no reflection), but quantum mechanics predicts partial reflection.

### Potential Step (E < V₀)
$$R = 1$$
Total reflection, though wave penetrates into barrier (evanescent wave).

### Potential Barrier (E < V₀)
$$R = 1 - T < 1$$
Some tunneling occurs, so reflection is not total.

## Physical Interpretation
R is the fraction of incident particles that are scattered backward by the potential. In steady-state scattering, it's the ratio of reflected flux to incident flux.
