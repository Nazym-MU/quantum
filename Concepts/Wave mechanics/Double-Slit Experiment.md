Particles with definite momentum pass through two slits separated by distance d. Interference pattern appears on detection screen even when particles arrive one at a time.
## Interference Condition
**Maxima:** d sin θ = nλ (n = 0, ±1, ±2, ...)  
**Minima:** d sin θ = (n + 1/2)λ
where λ = h/p is de Broglie wavelength.
## Quantum Explanation
Single particle has amplitudes to reach detector via **both paths**. These amplitudes interfere constructively or destructively depending on path difference.
## Uncertainty Principle's Role
Attempting to determine which slit particle passes through requires position measurement with Δx < d/2, forcing momentum uncertainty Δpₓ > 2ℏ/d. This angular uncertainty Δθ ~ λ/d destroys interference pattern.
**Key insight:** Uncertainty principle prevents knowing "which path" while observing interference - maintaining logical consistency.
## Classical vs Quantum Limits
For macroscopic objects (m ~ 1g, v ~ 1 cm/s): position uncertainty ~10⁻²¹ cm (negligible).  
For electrons in atoms: uncertainty ~10⁻⁸ cm (comparable to atom size) - quantum effects dominate.
Scale set by ℏ.
$$\Delta \theta = \frac{\Delta p}{p}$$
comes from small angle approximation $\tan \theta \approx \theta$, where we're dividing the transverse $\Delta p$ by the forward $p$. Then, $\Delta \theta \approx \frac{2\hbar/d}{p} = \frac{2\hbar}{pd}$, where $\lambda = h/p = 2\pi \hbar/p$, so $\Delta \theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{d}$.
