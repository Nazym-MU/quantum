$$[\hat x_i, \hat P_j] = i\hbar\delta_{ij}$$
where i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3} represent {x, y, z} components and δᵢⱼ is the Kronecker delta.
**Same direction** (non-zero commutators):
- $[x̂, \hat P_x] = iℏ$
- $[ŷ, \hat P_y] = iℏ$
- $[ẑ, \hat P_z] = iℏ$
Orthogonal directions commute.
## Physical interpretation
Position and momentum in the **same direction** are incompatible observables: cannot be measured simultaneously with arbitrary precision.
Position and momentum in **orthogonal directions** are compatible.
## Momentum components commute
$[P̂_i, P̂_j] = 0$ for all i, j
=> simultaneous eigenstates |p⟩ with definite $p_x, p_y, p_z$
## Derivation from translation
The commutator follows from requiring $$\hat T(a_je_j)x̂_i|ψ⟩ = (x_i + a_j\delta_{ij})\hat T(a_je_j)|ψ⟩$$
