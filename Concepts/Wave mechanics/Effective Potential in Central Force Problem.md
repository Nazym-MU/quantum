$$V_\text{eff}(r) = \frac{l(l+1)ℏ^2}{2μr^2} + V(r)$$
First term arises from rotational kinetic energy $\hat L^2/2μr^2 = \hat L^2/2I$, where $I = μr²$ is moment of inertia. This term acts as a repulsive barrier preventing the particle from reaching $r = 0$, except when l = 0 (no angular momentum).
## Examples
**Hydrogen atom** (V = -e²/r):
$$V_\text{eff}(r) = \frac{l(l+1)ℏ^2}{2μr^2} - \frac{e^2}{r}$$
**Free particle** (V = 0):
$$V_\text{eff}(r) = \frac{l(l+1)ℏ^2}{2μr^2}$$
