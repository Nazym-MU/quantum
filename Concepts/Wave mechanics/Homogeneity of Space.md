Physical laws are identical at all points in space. Physics is invariant under spatial translations.
For any physical system, translating it by any vector a leaves the physics unchanged:
$[\hat H,\hat T(a)] = 0$ for all a.
## Conservation
Homogeneity of space is equivalent to conservation of linear momentum.
- **Homogeneous**: Same everywhere (translational symmetry)
- **Isotropic**: Same in all directions (rotational symmetry)
Space appears to be both homogeneous and isotropic at large scales.
## Fundamental Status
All fundamental interactions (strong, weak, electromagnetic, gravitational) respect translational symmetry. This is built into the structure of physical law.
