Physical laws are identical in all directions. Physics is invariant under rotations.
$$[\hat H, \hat R(θ\hat n)] = 0$$ for all angles $θ$ and axes $\hat n$.
This is  equivalent to conservation of angular momentum.
Noether's theorem: continuous symmetries correspond to conserved quantities.
## Breaking Isotropy
External fields can break rotational symmetry. Example: applying a magnetic field along the z-axis makes that direction special. Energy then depends on angular momentum projection m along that axis. This breaks isotropy but is consistent with the laws of physics: the combined system (atom + magnetic field) determines the preferred direction.
## Fundamental Status
All fundamental interactions respect rotational symmetry in their intrinsic form. Preferred directions arise only from external conditions or boundary conditions, not from the laws themselves.
