# de Broglie Wavelength

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$

where h = 2πℏ is Planck's constant and p is particle momentum.

## Physical Meaning
Wavelength associated with matter wave of particle with momentum p. Links particle and wave descriptions.

## Origin
From photon relations E = hf and p = E/c:
$$\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{h}{p}$$

Extended by de Broglie to matter particles.

## Applications
- Interference patterns in double-slit experiment
- Electron diffraction
- Neutron interferometry
- Determines scale of quantum effects

## Example Values
Electron (p ~ 10⁻¹⁹ g·cm/s): λ ~ 10⁻⁸ cm (atomic scale)  
Helium atom (v = 2.2 km/s): λ ~ 45 pm  
Baseball (m = 145g, v = 40 m/s): λ ~ 10⁻³⁴ m (unobservably small)
