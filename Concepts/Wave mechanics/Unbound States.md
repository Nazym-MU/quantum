# Unbound States

## Definition
States where the particle is not confined to a finite spatial region. The particle's energy exceeds the potential energy at spatial infinity, allowing it to escape to x = ±∞.

## Energy Spectrum
Unlike [[Bound States]], energy eigenvalues form a **continuum** rather than discrete levels. Any E > V(±∞) is allowed.

## Wave Functions
- Oscillatory everywhere (or in accessible regions)
- Cannot be normalized to 1 (infinite extent)
- Represent idealized plane waves; physical states are [[Wave Packets]]

## Scattering Context
Unbound states are relevant for:
- [[Potential Step Scattering]]
- [[Potential Barrier Scattering]]  
- Analyzed via [[Reflection Coefficient]] and [[Transmission Coefficient]]

## Mathematical Form
For constant potential V, with E > V:
$$\psi(x) = Ae^{ikx} + Be^{-ikx}$$
where k = √(2m(E-V))/ℏ

Compare to bound states where ψ → 0 as x → ±∞.
