The wave function is the position-space amplitude:
$$\psi(x) = \langle x|\psi\rangle$$
It gives the probability amplitude to find the particle at position x.
## Probability Interpretation
**Probability density:**
$$P(x)dx = |\psi(x)|^2 dx = \langle x|\psi\rangle^* \langle x|\psi\rangle \, dx$$
**Normalization:**
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1$$
## Why "Wave" Function?
- Often has oscillatory (wavelike) structure
- Momentum eigenstates are pure waves: $⟨x|p⟩ = 1/\sqrt{2πℏ} e^{ipx/ℏ}$
- Satisfies wave equation (Schrödinger equation)
## Expectation Values
**Position:**
$$\langle x\rangle = \int dx \, x|\psi(x)|^2$$
**General observable acting in position space:**
$$\langle \hat{A}\rangle = \int dx \, \psi^*(x)\hat{A}\psi(x)$$
## Key Point
ψ(x) contains complete information about position measurements, but the particle doesn't "have" a definite position until measured.
