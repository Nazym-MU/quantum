**Vector operator** with three components:
$$\hat{\vec{J}} = (\hat{J}_x, \hat{J}_y, \hat{J}_z)$$
- Each component is a [[Hermitian Operators|Hermitian operator]].
- [[Commutation Relations]] - components don't commute with each other:
$$[\hat{J}_x, \hat{J}_y] = i\hbar\hat{J}_z \quad (\text{cyclic permutations})$$
- But Ĵ² commutes with all components
## Squared Magnitude Operator
$$\hat{J}^2 = \hat{J}_x^2 + \hat{J}_y^2 + \hat{J}_z^2$$
- Also Hermitian
- Squared magnitude of total angular momentum
## Physical Meaning
- **$Ĵ_z$**: Measurement gives $m\hbar$ where m is the magnetic quantum number
- **$Ĵ^2$**: Measurement gives $j(j+1)\hbar^2$ where j is total angular momentum quantum number
- Cannot measure all three components simultaneously
## Types of Angular Momentum
1. **Orbital** ($\hat{L}$): Due to spatial motion, j must be integer
2. **Spin** ($\hat{S}$): Intrinsic, j can be half-integer  
3. **Total** ($\hat{J}$): Combination of orbital and spin
