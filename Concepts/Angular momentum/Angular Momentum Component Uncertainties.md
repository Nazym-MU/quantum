From \[Jₓ, Jz\] = iℏJy and general uncertainty relation:
$$\Delta J_x \cdot \Delta J_z \geq \frac{\hbar|\langle J_y \rangle|}{2}$$
(plus cyclic permutations)
## Physical Consequences
**Why we can't measure all three components:**
If Jz has definite value (ΔJz = 0), then ⟨Jz⟩ ≠ 0, which forces ΔJₓ → ∞ by the uncertainty relation.
**Angular momentum never points along axis:**
If J pointed along z-axis, then Jₓ = Jy = 0 exactly. But this violates uncertainty relations when Jz ≠ 0.
## Connection to Stern-Gerlach
Measuring Sz forces uncertainty in Sₓ, explaining why sequential measurements along different axes give probabilistic outcomes.
