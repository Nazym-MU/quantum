$$x = r\sin\theta\cos\phi, \quad y = r\sin\theta\sin\phi, \quad z = r\cos\theta$$
## Y₁,₀ ($p_z$ orbital)
$$Y_{1,0} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}} \cos\theta = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}} \frac{z}{r}$$
Probability density concentrated along z-axis.
## Y₁,±₁ (Complex p orbitals)
$$Y_{1,\pm 1} = \mp\sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}} \sin\theta \, e^{\pm i\phi} = \mp\sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}} \frac{x \pm iy}{r}$$
These have definite angular momentum about z-axis.
## Real $p_x$ and $p_y$ Orbitals
Linear combinations give real orbitals:
$$p_x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(Y_{1,-1} - Y_{1,1}) = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}} \frac{x}{r}$$
$$p_y = \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}(Y_{1,-1} + Y_{1,1}) = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}} \frac{y}{r}$$
These are the familiar p orbitals from chemistry, oriented along x and y axes.
## Why Use Linear Combinations?
**Complex combinations** ($Y_{l,\pm m}$):
- Eigenstates of $\hat{L}_z$
- Have definite angular momentum projection
- Natural for systems with rotational symmetry (atoms in magnetic fields)

**Real combinations** ($p_x, p_y$):
- Better for visualizing directional properties
- Natural for molecules without spherical symmetry
- Used in molecular orbital theory

## Application to Molecular Bonding

The directional nature of p orbitals explains molecular geometry:

**H₂O example**: Oxygen has electrons in $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals. Hydrogen atoms bond along these directions, giving ~90° angle (observed 105° due to H-H repulsion).

**NH₃ example**: Nitrogen has electrons in $p_x$, $p_y$, $p_z$ orbitals. Three hydrogen atoms bond at ~90° angles, forming pyramidal (not planar) structure.
