## Definition
A Bell state measurement (Bell-state measurement) is a projective measurement onto the Bell basis—a complete orthonormal basis for two-particle spin-1/2 systems where each basis state is maximally entangled.

## The Four Bell Basis States

**Singlet & Triplet (S=0 and S=1):**
$$|\Psi^{-}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle_1|-z\rangle_2 - |-z\rangle_1|+z\rangle_2)$$ (singlet, total spin 0)

$$|\Psi^{+}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle_1|-z\rangle_2 + |-z\rangle_1|+z\rangle_2)$$ (triplet, total spin 1)

**Bell Φ states (not total spin eigenstates):**
$$|\Phi^{+}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle_1|+z\rangle_2 + |-z\rangle_1|-z\rangle_2)$$

$$|\Phi^{-}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle_1|+z\rangle_2 - |-z\rangle_1|-z\rangle_2)$$

## Key Property
Each state is entangled—cannot be factored into a product of single-particle states. They form a complete basis, so any two-particle state can be expanded in this basis.

## Role in Teleportation
When Alice measures particles 1 and 2 in the Bell basis, she projects them into one of four entangled configurations. Each outcome forces particle 3 (Bob's particle) into a specific state determined by the original state |ψ₁⟩ and Alice's measurement result.
