**Definition:** Potential energy:
$$V(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & |x| < a/2 \\ \infty & |x| > a/2 \end{cases}$$

Limit of [[Finite Square Well]] as V₀ → ∞.

**Boundary Conditions:**
$$\psi(\pm a/2) = 0$$

Wave function must vanish at infinite walls. See [[Boundary Conditions for Wave Functions]].

**Energy Eigenfunctions:**
$$\psi_n(x) = \begin{cases} \sqrt{2/a}\cos(n\pi x/a) & n = 1,3,5,... \\ \sqrt{2/a}\sin(n\pi x/a) & n = 2,4,6,... \end{cases}$$

for |x| < a/2, and ψₙ(x) = 0 elsewhere.

**Energy Eigenvalues:**
$$E_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2ma^2}, \quad n = 1,2,3,...$$

**Key Properties:**
- Quantization condition: k_n a = nπ
- Number of nodes = n - 1
- Higher energy → more rapid oscillation → more nodes
- Ground state (n=1) has zero nodes
- Parity: even n → odd function, odd n → even function

**Physical Insight:**
Particle completely confined. No penetration into walls. Only wavelengths λ = 2a/n fit in the box with nodes at boundaries.
