**Physical Origin:** Spatial confinement imposes constraints on allowed wavelengths, which quantizes energy.

**General Mechanism:**

**Step 1:** Confinement sets boundary conditions on ψ(x)

**Step 2:** Only specific wavelengths satisfy these conditions

**Step 3:** Since E ∝ k² and k = 2π/λ, only discrete energies allowed

**Example: Particle in a Box**

Boundary conditions: ψ(±a/2) = 0

Allowed wavelengths: λₙ = 2a/n, n = 1,2,3,...

Corresponding momenta: pₙ = h/λₙ = nh/(2a)

Energies: Eₙ = pₙ²/(2m) = n²h²/(8ma²)

**General Pattern:**

For potential well of width a:
$$E_n \propto \frac{n^2}{a^2}$$

- Smaller box → larger energy spacing
- Ground state has lowest possible energy (not zero!)
- Node number increases with energy

**Wave Function Characteristics:**

**E < V region:** Exponential decay, d²ψ/dx² = +q²ψ
- Function bends away from axis

**E > V region:** Oscillatory, d²ψ/dx² = -k²ψ  
- Function bends toward axis
- Larger E → larger k → more rapid oscillation

**Inflection Point:** At E = V(x), d²ψ/dx² = 0
