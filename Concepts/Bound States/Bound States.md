**Definition:** A quantum state where the particle is confined to a spatial region and cannot escape to infinity.

**Physical Condition:** E < V(x → ±∞)

The particle's total energy is less than the potential energy at infinity, so classically it would be trapped.

**Wave Function Behavior:**
- Must be normalizable: ∫|ψ(x)|² dx < ∞
- Decays to zero as x → ±∞
- Exhibits exponential decay in classically forbidden regions

**Energy Quantization:**
Boundary conditions on ψ(x) restrict allowed energies to discrete values E₁, E₂, E₃, ...

**Contrast with Scattering States:**
- Bound: E < V(∞), discrete energies, normalizable
- Scattering: E > V(∞), continuous energies, extended states

**Examples:**
- [[Finite Square Well]]
- [[Infinite Square Well (Particle in a Box)]]
