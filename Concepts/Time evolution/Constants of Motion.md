> Observables whose expectation values do not change as the quantum system evolves in time.
## General Condition [[<6>]]
An observable  is a constant of motion if:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\braket{A} = \frac{i}{\hbar}\braket{[\hat{H}, \hat{A}]} + \braket{\frac{\partial \hat{A}}{\partial t}} = 0$$
## When is ⟨Â⟩ Conserved?
Two requirements:
1. **\[Ĥ, Â\] = 0** (A commutes with Hamiltonian)
2. **∂Â/∂t = 0** (A has no explicit time dependence)
## Special Case: Energy
When Ĥ is time-independent:
- \[Ĥ, Ĥ\] = 0 trivially
- ∂Ĥ/∂t = 0 by assumption
- Therefore ⟨Ĥ⟩ is always a constant of motion
- This is **energy conservation**
## Physical Interpretation
"Constant of motion" = "quantity that doesn't change during time evolution"
The term "motion" refers to the time evolution of the quantum state, not spatial movement.
