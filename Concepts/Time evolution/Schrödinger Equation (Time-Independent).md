**Definition:** Eigenvalue equation for the Hamiltonian operator. Determines energy eigenstates.
$$\hat{H}\ket{E_n} = E_n\ket{E_n}$$
- Relationship to Time-Dependent Form when Ĥ is time-independent and ψ is an energy eigenstate [[(14)]]. It just finds the special states (energy eigenstates), when time evolution is just a phase factor.
## Purpose
- Finds allowed energy levels E_n
- Finds corresponding [[Stationary States]] |E_n⟩
- Forms the basis for solving general time evolution
## General Solution Strategy
1. Solve $Ĥ|E_n⟩ = E_n|E_n⟩$ for all n
2. Expand initial state: $|ψ(0)⟩ = Σ c_n|E_n⟩$
3. Time evolution: $|ψ(t)⟩ = Σ c_n e^{-iE_n t/ℏ}|E_n⟩$
## Why "Time-Independent"?
- The equation itself has no time derivatives
- Finds states whose spatial structure doesn't change
- Only overall phase evolves: e^(-iEt/ℏ)
