$$\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$
## What Δt Actually Means
**Not** uncertainty in time measurement. Time is a parameter, not an observable.
Δt = time required for state to evolve noticeably = time for expectation values to change by ~ΔA.
Formally: $$\Delta t = \frac{\Delta A}{|d\langle A \rangle/dt|}$$
Interpretation: 
- **Large ΔE** (big energy spread) → **small Δt** (state evolves quickly)
- **Small ΔE** (narrow energy spread) → **large Δt** (state evolves slowly)
## Physical Applications
**Superposition states:** If ΔE is energy spread in state, Δt ~ ℏ/ΔE is timescale for observable phase evolution.
**Excited state lifetimes:** Decaying state with lifetime τ has energy uncertainty ΔE ~ ℏ/τ, causing natural linewidth in emitted photons.
**Stationary states:** Energy eigenstates have ΔE = 0, so Δt → ∞ (no evolution of observables).
