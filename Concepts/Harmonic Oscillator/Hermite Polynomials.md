Polynomials that arise as solutions to the [[Harmonic Oscillator]] Schrödinger equation in position space.

## Definition

Hermite polynomial Hₙ(y) satisfies the differential equation:
$$\frac{d^2H_n}{dy^2} - 2y\frac{dH_n}{dy} + 2nH_n = 0$$

Equivalently, Hₙ(y) is the degree-n polynomial part of the wave function:
$$\psi_n(y) = H_n(y)e^{-y^2/2}$$

where y = √(mω/ℏ) x is dimensionless position.

## First Few Polynomials

Derivation: [[First Three Hermite Polynomials]]

- H₀(y) = 1
- H₁(y) = y
- H₂(y) = 2y² - 1 (or 1-2y², convention varies)
- H₃(y) = y(2y² - 3)
- H₄(y) = 4y⁴ - 12y² + 3

## Properties

**Degree**: Hₙ(y) has degree n

**Parity**: 
- Even n → even polynomial: Hₙ(-y) = Hₙ(y)
- Odd n → odd polynomial: Hₙ(-y) = -Hₙ(y)

**Nodes**: Hₙ(y) has exactly n real zeros (related to [[Node Structure in Energy Eigenstates]])

**Recursion**: Generated by
$$H_{n+1}(y) = 2yH_n(y) - 2nH_{n-1}(y)$$

**Orthogonality**: 
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} H_n(y)H_m(y)e^{-y^2}dy = \sqrt{\pi}2^n n! \delta_{nm}$$

## Connection to Wave Functions

Complete harmonic oscillator wave functions:
$$\langle x|n\rangle = N_n H_n\left(\sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}}x\right)\exp\left(-\frac{m\omega x^2}{2\hbar}\right)$$

where Nₙ is normalization constant.

## How They Arise

Position-space Schrödinger equation leads to power series. Normalizability requires series termination, producing finite polynomials.

## Mathematical Context

Hermite polynomials belong to family of classical orthogonal polynomials:
- Hermite (harmonic oscillator)
- Legendre (angular momentum, θ dependence)
- Laguerre (hydrogen atom, radial part)

Each solves quantum mechanical problem with specific symmetry.
