The number of zeros (nodes) in the wave function ⟨x|n⟩ of a bound state.
## Harmonic Oscillator

For the [[Harmonic Oscillator]], the energy eigenstate |n⟩ has exactly **n nodes** in its position-space wave function ⟨x|n⟩.

**Examples**:
- |0⟩: Gaussian with no nodes (always positive)
- |1⟩: One node at x = 0 (function changes sign)
- |2⟩: Two nodes at x = ±√(ℏ/mω)

## Physical Origin

Nodes arise from the increasing oscillatory character of wave functions at higher energies. 

The number of nodes relates to kinetic energy:
$$\langle \hat{p}^2 \rangle = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \langle x|n\rangle \frac{d^2}{dx^2}\langle x|n\rangle dx$$

More nodes → larger second derivative → larger curvature → higher kinetic energy.

## General Principle

For any one-dimensional bound state potential:
- Ground state has zero nodes
- First excited state has one node
- nth excited state has n nodes

This is a general theorem in quantum mechanics.

## Parity and Nodes

For symmetric potentials V(-x) = V(x) like the harmonic oscillator:
- Even parity states (n even): symmetric about origin
- Odd parity states (n odd): antisymmetric with node at x = 0
