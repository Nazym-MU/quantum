The non-zero ground state energy $E_0 = ½ℏω$ of the [[Harmonic Oscillator]].
## Physical Origin

Zero-point energy arises from the [[Uncertainty|uncertainty principle]]. If the ground state had E = 0, both kinetic and potential energy would vanish:
- Zero potential energy requires ⟨x²⟩ = 0, so Δx = 0
- Zero kinetic energy requires ⟨p²⟩ = 0, so Δp = 0
But Δx = 0 and Δp = 0 violates ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2 from [[General Uncertainty Relation from Commutators]].

## Energy Balance

For any state of the harmonic oscillator:
$$\langle E \rangle = \frac{\langle p^2 \rangle}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2\langle x^2 \rangle = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2(\Delta x)^2$$

since ⟨x⟩ = ⟨p⟩ = 0 in energy eigenstates.

Nature minimizes energy by balancing position and momentum uncertainties. For the ground state:
- ⟨Δx²⟩ = ℏ/2mω
- ⟨Δp²⟩ = mℏω/2
- This gives E₀ = ℏω/4m · mℏω/2 + mω²/2 · ℏ/2mω = ½ℏω

## Minimum Uncertainty

The ground state saturates the uncertainty relation:
$$\Delta x \Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

This is the minimum allowed by quantum mechanics. The ground state wave function is a [[Gaussian Wave Packet]], which is the minimum uncertainty wave packet.

## Physical Consequences

**Helium**: Does not solidify at atmospheric pressure even at T = 0 because zero-point energy keeps atoms moving. The combination of small mass m and weak attraction (small ω) makes Δx large enough to prevent solidification.

**Casimir Effect**: Zero-point energy of electromagnetic field creates measurable forces between conducting plates.

**Vacuum Fluctuations**: Even empty space has energy from zero-point motion of quantum fields.

## Classical vs Quantum

Classically, the lowest energy occurs at:
- x = 0 (equilibrium position, V = 0)
- p = 0 (particle at rest, KE = 0)  
- Total energy = 0

Quantum mechanically, this is impossible due to [x̂,p̂] = iℏ.
