The Hermitian operator N̂ = â†â for the [[Harmonic Oscillator]] whose eigenvalues count the number of quanta.
## Definition
$$\hat{N} = \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a}$$
where â and â† are [[Ladder Operators]].
## Eigenvalue Equation

$$\hat{N}|n\rangle = n|n\rangle, \quad n = 0,1,2,\ldots$$
The eigenvalues are non-negative integers. The state |n⟩ contains n quanta of excitation.
Derivation: [[Number Operator Eigenvalue Derivation]]
## Relation to Hamiltonian
The [[Harmonic Oscillator]] Hamiltonian can be written as:
$$\hat{H} = \hbar\omega\left(\hat{N} + \frac{1}{2}\right)$$
Derivation: [[Hamiltonian in Terms of Number Operator]]
Therefore:
$$\hat{H}|n\rangle = \hbar\omega\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)|n\rangle = E_n|n\rangle$$
## Commutation Relations
$$[\hat{N}, \hat{a}] = -\hat{a} \qquad [\hat{N}, \hat{a}^\dagger] = \hat{a}^\dagger$$

These show that â lowers the eigenvalue by 1, while â† raises it by 1.
## Expectation Value
The expectation value in state |n⟩ gives the average number of quanta:
$$\langle n|\hat{N}|n\rangle = n$$
For the ground state:
$$\langle 0|\hat{N}|0\rangle = 0$$
which is why it's called the "vacuum" state in quantum field theory.
## Physical Interpretation
- In quantum optics: N̂ counts photons
- In solid state physics: N̂ counts phonons (lattice vibrations)
- In particle physics: N̂ counts field quanta
The eigenvalue n represents the occupation number of the mode.
