# Classical Turning Points

Points where a particle's kinetic energy becomes zero in classical mechanics, marking the boundaries of allowed motion.

## Definition

For a particle with total energy E in potential V(x), the classical turning points xₜ satisfy:
$$E = V(x_t)$$

At these points, all energy is potential and kinetic energy is zero.

## Harmonic Oscillator

For the [[Harmonic Oscillator]] with V(x) = ½mω²x², the turning points for energy eigenstate |n⟩ are:

$$E_n = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x_n^2$$

$$\hbar\omega\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x_n^2$$

Solving for xₙ:
$$x_n = \pm\sqrt{\frac{(2n+1)\hbar}{m\omega}}$$

## Quantum vs Classical Behavior

**Classical**: Particle cannot exist beyond turning points (would require negative kinetic energy).

**Quantum**: Wave function ⟨x|n⟩ extends beyond turning points, exhibiting [[Quantum Tunneling]] into classically forbidden regions.

However, as n increases:
- The fraction of probability beyond turning points decreases
- The quantum behavior approaches classical predictions
- See: [[Harmonic Oscillator Wave Functions]]

## Spatial Extent

The distance between turning points increases with energy:
$$\Delta x_n = 2x_n = 2\sqrt{\frac{(2n+1)\hbar}{m\omega}}$$

For large n:
$$\Delta x_n \approx 2\sqrt{\frac{2n\hbar}{m\omega}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{2E_n}{m\omega^2}}$$

which is the classical amplitude for energy Eₙ.
