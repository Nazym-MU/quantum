**Local realism** is the philosophical position that:
- **Realism**: Physical properties have definite values independent of measurement
	- A particle's spin-z is either +ℏ/2 or -ℏ/2 *before* we measure it
- **Locality**: No instantaneous action at a distance
	- Events at distant locations are independent
Einstein believed properties exist objectively, independent of observation.
## Hidden Variable Theory
To preserve local realism, Einstein proposed:
- Particles carry **hidden variables** that preset what outcome you'll get. When you measure, you reveal the hidden variable.
- No instantaneous influence between distant particles
### Example: Two Spin-1/2 Particles in |0,0⟩
- Particle 1: {+z, +x, -y} means "if measured along z give +ℏ/2, along x give +ℏ/2, along y give -ℏ/2"
- Particle 2: {-z, -x, +y} (opposite signs, conserving angular momentum)

[[Bell's Inequality]] proves this can't work. For certain measurement angles, hidden variable theories make predictions that differ from quantum mechanics. Experiments show **quantum mechanics wins**.
