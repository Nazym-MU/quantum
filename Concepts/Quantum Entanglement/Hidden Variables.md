Instead of accepting genuine uncertainty in quantum systems, propose:
- Particles carry "hidden" properties determining all measurement outcomes
- Once found, quantum mechanics becomes deterministic like classical physics
## Example: Hidden Variable Model for |0,0‚ü©
Three axes: a, b, c and eight population types:

| Particle 1   | Particle 2   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| {+a, +b, +c} | {-a, -b, -c} |
| {+a, +b, -c} | {-a, -b, +c} |
| {+a, -b, +c} | {-a, +b, -c} |
| {+a, -b, -c} | {-a, +b, +c} |
| {-a, +b, +c} | {+a, -b, -c} |
| {-a, +b, -c} | {+a, -b, +c} |
| {-a, -b, +c} | {+a, +b, -c} |
| {-a, -b, -c} | {+a, +b, +c} |
Each pair type is produced with equal probability.
## Properties
- **Deterministic:** Once type is assigned, outcome is predetermined. Apparent randomness only from not knowing type.
- **Conservation of momentum:** Opposite particle types ensure opposite spins along any axis.
- **Local:** Each particle's type fixed at creation. Alice's choice doesn't affect particle 2's type.
## Can Reproduce Quantum Mechanics?
Two axes only: yes, hidden variables match all predictions.
Three or more axes: no. [[Bell's Inequality]] proves hidden variables must violate quantum predictions.
