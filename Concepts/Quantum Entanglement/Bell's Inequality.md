For any local hidden-variable theory:
$$P(+a; +b) \leq P(+a; +c) + P(+c; +b)$$
Where P(+a;+b) = probability both particles give +ℏ/2 when A measures along **a**, B measures along **b**.
In terms of quantum probabilities:
$$\sin^2\frac{\theta_{ab}}{2} \leq \sin^2\frac{\theta_{ac}}{2} + \sin^2\frac{\theta_{bc}}{2}$$
## Violation
When c bisects angle between a and b, with θ_ab = 2φ:
**At φ = 60°:**
- Left side: sin²(60°) = 3/4
- Right side: 2·sin²(30°) = 1/2, violation
## Implication
Hidden variables must satisfy the inequality. Quantum mechanics violates it. Experiments confirm quantum mechanics.
Therefore: Hidden variable theories cannot explain nature.
At least one of these is false:
1. Realism (particles have definite properties)
2. Locality (no instantaneous action at distance)
## Origin
Derived from [[Counting Argument for Bell's Inequality]]:
For three sets AB, AC, CB (counting pairs giving +ℏ/2 for respective axes). Every pair in AB must appear in AC or CB (or both). Therefore: |AB| ≤ |AC| + |CB|
