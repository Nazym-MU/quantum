Two spin-1/2 particles in state:
$$|0,0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|+z,-z\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|-z,+z\rangle$$

Alice measures particle 1 along z-axis → gets +ℏ/2.
Immediate consequence: Particle 2's state collapses to |-z⟩.
## The Problem
Alice and Bob are light-years apart. How can measuring here instantly affect the state there?
Einstein's objects.

Alice can choose to measure along x-axis instead of z-axis. Key fact: From [[Commutation Relations]], a particle cannot have both definite Sz AND definite Sx.
If particle 2 has preset Sz = -ℏ/2, it cannot simultaneously have preset Sx. Yet if Alice measures along x and gets +ℏ/2, particle 2's Sx must be -ℏ/2 (by anti-correlation).
## Resolution
[[Bell's Inequality]] proves no hidden variable theory can work.
## Non-Locality vs. No-Communication
**Distinction:**
- Non-locality exists: measuring particle 1 instantaneously affects particle 2's state (locality violated - objects can influence beyond immediate surroundings).
- But no FTL communication: Alice can't control her result, so can't send signal to Bob - an effect cannot precede its cause (no causality violated).
Correlation without causation.
