Effective mass of a single particle moving in the relative coordinate system. It converts the two-body problem into an equivalent one-body problem.

$$μ = \frac{m_1m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$$
Also expressible as: $$\frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{1}{m_1} + \frac{1}{m_2}$$
## Limiting cases
- **Equal masses** (m₁ = m₂ = m): 
	- μ = m/2 (half the individual mass)
- m₁ >> m₂: 
	- μ ≈ m₂ (approximately the smaller mass) 
	- Example: For hydrogen atom, proton mass ≈ 2000 × electron mass, so μ ≈ mₑ
- **One mass infinite** (m₁ → ∞): 
	- μ → m₂ (exactly the finite mass)
This is the limit of a particle moving in a fixed external potential.
## Role in Hamiltonian
In relative coordinates, the kinetic energy term for a single particle of mass μ in the potential V(r) is $p̂^2/2μ$.
