Change of coordinates for two-body problem that separates center-of-mass motion from relative motion.
## Coordinate Definitions
- **Relative position**: r̂ = r̂₁ - r̂₂  
- **Center-of-mass position** (Mass-weighted average position): $$\hat R = \frac{m_1\hat r_1 + m_2\hat r_2}{m_1 + m_2}$$
## Momentum Definitions
- **Total momentum**: $\hat P = \hat p_1 + \hat p_2$
- **Relative momentum** (Mass-weighted momentum difference): $$\hat p = \frac{m_2\hat p_1 - m_1\hat p_2}{m_1 + m_2}$$
## Commutation Relations
- **Center-of-mass canonical pair**:
$$[\hat R,\hat P] = iℏ$$
**Relative canonical pair**:
$$[r̂, p̂] = iℏ$$
**Cross terms (all commute)**:
- $[r̂, \hat P] = 0$
- $[\hat R, p̂] = 0$
- $[r̂_i, r̂_j] = 0$ and $[\hat p_i, \hat p_j] = 0$
Relative and center-of-mass variables are independent.
The two-body problem naturally separates into:
1. **Motion of the center of mass**
2. **Relative motion**
The potential $V(|r̂_1 - r̂_2|) = V(r)$ depends only on relative coordinate, not on center-of-mass position.
