Characteristic length scale for hydrogen atom and atomic physics.

$$a_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{\mu e^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\mu c \alpha}$$

where:
- $\mu$ is the reduced mass
- $e$ is elementary charge
- $\alpha = e^2/\hbar c$ is fine-structure constant

## Numerical Value

For hydrogen: $a_0 = 0.529$ Å = $0.0529$ nm

## Physical Meaning

**Characteristic size of hydrogen atom** - the typical distance of electron from nucleus in ground state.

More precisely: Most probable radius in ground state = $a_0$ (for $Z=1$)

## Scaling with Z

For hydrogenic atom with nuclear charge $Z$:

$$a_0(Z) = \frac{a_0}{Z}$$

Higher $Z$ → more tightly bound electron → smaller atomic radius.

## Role in Wave Functions

The radial wave functions naturally involve $a_0$:

$$R_{nl}(r) \propto e^{-Zr/na_0} \times \text{polynomial in } (r/a_0)$$

**Ground state**: $\psi_{100} \propto e^{-r/a_0}$

**Excited states**: $\psi_{nlm} \propto e^{-Zr/na_0}$

## Relationship to Other Scales

**Compton wavelength**: $\lambda_C = \hbar/m_e c$

$$a_0 = \frac{\lambda_C}{\alpha} \approx 137 \lambda_C$$

Atomic size is much larger than Compton wavelength due to small $\alpha$.

**Classical electron radius**: $r_e = e^2/m_e c^2 = \alpha \lambda_C$

$$a_0 = \frac{\lambda_C}{\alpha} = \frac{r_e}{\alpha^2} \approx 137^2 r_e$$

## Connection to Energy Scale

$$E_1 = -\frac{e^2}{2a_0} = -\frac{\mu c^2 \alpha^2}{2} = -13.6 \text{ eV}$$

The Bohr radius sets the length scale, which determines the energy scale of atomic physics.

## Generalization

For state with principal quantum number $n$ and angular momentum $l = n-1$:

$$r_{\text{max}} = \frac{n^2 a_0}{Z}$$

This is where the radial probability density peaks - the "shell radius" for that level.

## Historical Context

Named after Niels Bohr, who derived it in his 1913 semi-classical model. Quantum mechanics confirms this as the natural atomic length scale.
