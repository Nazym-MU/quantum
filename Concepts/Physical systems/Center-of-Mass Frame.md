Reference frame where the center of mass is at rest ($\hat{P} = 0$).
=> Total momentum vanishes: $\hat P = \hat P_1 + \hat P_2 = 0$
Equivalently: $d\hat R/dt = 0$ (center of mass doesn't move)
## Energy in CM Frame
Center-of-mass kinetic energy vanishes:
=> $E_\text{total} = E_\text{rel}$
All energy is in the relative motion between particles.
In the CM frame, particles move symmetrically around their common center of mass. No external forces.
## Momentum Eigenfunctions
In position representation:
$$⟨R|P⟩ = \frac{1}{(2πℏ)^{3/2}} e^{iP\cdot R/ℏ}$$
Setting P = 0 gives ⟨R|0⟩ = constant (uniform in space).
## Working in CM Frame
The relative Hamiltonian describes all the physics:
$$\hat H_{\text{rel}} = \frac{\hat p^2}{2μ} + V(r)$$
This is mathematically identical to a single particle of mass μ in potential V(r).
