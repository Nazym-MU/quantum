$$E_n = -\frac{\mu Z^2 e^4}{2\hbar^2 n^2} = -\frac{\mu c^2 Z^2 \alpha^2}{2n^2}$$
where:
- $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ is the **principal quantum number**
- $\alpha = e^2/\hbar c \approx 1/137$ is the fine-structure constant
- $\mu$ is the reduced mass
## For Hydrogen (Z = 1)
$$E_n = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{n^2}$$
Specific values:
- $E_1 = -13.6$ eV (ground state)
- $E_2 = -3.4$ eV
- $E_3 = -1.51$ eV
- $E_\infty = 0$ (ionization threshold)
## Physical Interpretation
**Negative energy**: Bound states (electron confined to atom)
**As $n \to \infty$**: $E_n \to 0$ (ionization - electron escapes to infinity with zero kinetic energy)
**Ionization energy**: Energy needed to remove electron from ground state = $|E_1| = 13.6$ eV
## Energy Differences
When atom transitions from $n_i$ to $n_f$ (with $n_f < n_i$), it emits a photon:
$$\Delta E = E_{n_i} - E_{n_f} = \frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{n_f^2} - \frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{n_i^2} = 13.6 \text{ eV} \left(\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2}\right)$$

Photon frequency: $h\nu = \Delta E$
$$E_1 \sim \mu c^2 \alpha^2 \sim (0.5 \text{ MeV}) \times (1/137)^2 \sim \text{eV}$$
The small fine-structure constant $\alpha^2 \approx 5 \times 10^{-5}$ explains why atomic energies are eV scale, not MeV scale.
## Comparison with Bohr Model
Bohr's semi-classical model (1913) gave the same energy formula, but quantum mechanics provides:
- Correct wave functions
- Proper understanding of angular momentum ($l=0$ ground state vs Bohr's $l=1$)
- Rigorous mathematical foundation
