## Definition
An EPR pair is two entangled spin-1/2 particles prepared in the [[Singlet State]] |0,0⟩. It's the physical resource required for quantum teleportation.

## Preparation
Start with a spin-0 particle and let it decay into two spin-1/2 particles. Since total angular momentum must be conserved (0 → 0), the two particles emerge in the singlet state.

## Properties
- Perfectly correlated: measuring one particle instantly determines the measurement outcome of the other
- No preferred direction: rotationally symmetric—the correlations hold in any measurement basis
- Maximally entangled: any measurement result on one particle is completely random until the other is measured

## Role in Teleportation
Particles 2 and 3 of the EPR pair are distributed to Alice and Bob before teleportation begins. This pre-shared entanglement is the key resource that makes teleportation possible. Without it, no amount of classical communication can transfer the state.

## Why Necessary
The EPR pair provides the "connection" between Alice and Bob's locations. It allows Alice's measurement to instantaneously affect Bob's particle in a way that depends on the original state—this is the essence of "spooky action at a distance."
