## Original Form

$$\hat H = \frac{P̂_1^2}{2m_1} +\frac{P̂_2^2}{2m_2} + V(|r̂₁ - r̂₂|)$$
## Separated Form
Ĥ = Ĥ_cm + Ĥ_rel
where:

**Center-of-mass Hamiltonian**: Ĥ_cm = P̂²/2M  
Free particle of total mass M = m₁ + m₂

**Relative Hamiltonian**: Ĥ_rel = p̂²/2μ + V(r)  
Particle of reduced mass μ in central potential
## Why Separation Works
The two Hamiltonians commute: [Ĥ_cm, Ĥ_rel] = 0
This is because:
- Center-of-mass variables (R̂, P̂) commute with relative variables (r̂, p̂)
- Potential V(r) depends only on relative coordinate

## Energy Eigenstates

Can find simultaneous eigenstates |E_cm, E_rel⟩:

Ĥ_cm|E_cm, E_rel⟩ = E_cm|E_cm, E_rel⟩  
Ĥ_rel|E_cm, E_rel⟩ = E_rel|E_cm, E_rel⟩

Total energy: E = E_cm + E_rel

## Solving the Problem

1. **Center-of-mass part**: Free particle problem (solved by plane waves)
2. **Relative part**: Single particle in central potential (the interesting physics)

This reduces the two-body problem to an effective one-body problem.
