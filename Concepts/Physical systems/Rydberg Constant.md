Fundamental constant determining wavelengths of spectral lines in hydrogen.
$$R_H = \frac{\mu c \alpha^2}{2\hbar}$$
where:
- $\mu$ is the reduced mass of the electron-nucleus system
- $c$ is speed of light
- $\alpha = e^2/\hbar c$ is the fine-structure constant
- $\hbar$ is reduced Planck constant
## Alternative Expression

$$R_H = \frac{\mu e^4}{4\pi\hbar^3 c}$$
## Numerical Value
For hydrogen: $R_H = 1.097 \times 10^7$ m$^{-1}$
## Role in Spectral Formula
Wavelength of emitted photon:

$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H Z^2 \left(\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2}\right)$$
Or in terms of frequency:
$$\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda} = R_H c Z^2 \left(\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2}\right)$$
## Isotope Dependence
The Rydberg constant depends on reduced mass:
$$\mu = \frac{m_e M_N}{m_e + M_N} = m_e\left(1 - \frac{m_e}{M_N}\right)$$

**Hydrogen** ($M_N = m_p$): $\mu_H \approx 0.9995 m_e$
**Deuterium** ($M_N = 2m_p$): $\mu_D \approx 0.9997 m_e$
This difference causes **isotope shift** in spectral lines:
$$\frac{R_D - R_H}{R_H} \approx \frac{m_e}{2m_p} \approx 2.7 \times 10^{-4}$$
H$_\alpha$ line (656.3 nm) shifts by ~0.18 nm between H and D.
## Connection to Energy Levels
$$E_n = -\frac{R_H h c Z^2}{n^2} = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV} \cdot Z^2}{n^2}$$
The Rydberg constant essentially sets the energy scale of atomic physics.
