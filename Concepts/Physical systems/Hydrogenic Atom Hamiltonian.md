$$\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2\mu} - \frac{Ze^2}{r}$$
where:
- $\mu = \frac{m_e M_N}{m_e + M_N}$ is the reduced mass
- $Z$ is the atomic number (nuclear charge in units of $e$)
- $e$ is the elementary charge
- $r = |\mathbf{r}|$ is the electron-nucleus separation
## Components
**Kinetic energy**: $\frac{\hat{p}^2}{2\mu}$
**Coulomb potential**: $V(r) = -\frac{Ze^2}{r}$
The negative sign indicates **attractive** interaction between opposite charges.
Describes hydrogenic atoms <- any atom with exactly one electron:
- $Z = 1$: Hydrogen (H)
- $Z = 2$: Singly ionized helium (He⁺)
- $Z = 3$: Doubly ionized lithium (Li⁺⁺)
- $Z = n$: $(n-1)$-times ionized atom with nuclear charge $Ze$
Also describes **positronium** ($e^+e^-$ bound state) with $Z=1$ and different reduced mass.
## Energy Scale
From the Coulomb potential $V \sim -e^2/a_0$ where $a_0 = \hbar^2/\mu e^2$:
$$E_{\text{scale}} \sim \frac{e^2}{a_0} = \frac{\mu e^4}{\hbar^2} = \mu c^2 \alpha^2$$
where $\alpha = e^2/\hbar c \approx 1/137$ is the fine-structure constant.
This gives $E_{\text{scale}} \sim 13.6$ eV for hydrogen.
