- |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ - vectors that form a basis of abstract quantum mechanical vector space.
- #ket_vector - quantum state
- #bra_vector - complex conjugate of ket
- bra + ket => form an inner product (amplitude)
	- $\braket{\phi | \psi}$ - [[Probability amplitude]] for a particle in the state |ψ⟩ to be found in the state |φ⟩

- Given a vector space V, the **dual space** V* is the vector space of all linear functionals in V.
 In quantum mechanics, bra vector is an operator ([[Linear functional]]) that acts on a ket and returns a scalar:
 -  $\braket{\phi || \psi}$ <- [[Inner product]]

 Probability amplitudes satisfy normalization [[(4)]]: 
$$\braket{\psi | \psi} = |c_+|^2+|c_-|^2=1$$
Its absolute square = probability density.
