## Why atoms get deflected
---
When a neutral atom enters a magnetic field, it experiences a force:
$$F = \nabla(\mu \cdot B)$$

Say, the field is the largest in z direction, so:
$$F_z = \mu_z \cdot \frac{\partial B}{\partial z}\approx \mu_z \frac{\partial B_z}{\partial z}$$
#### Classical physics:
- Magnetic moments with random orientations
- z component varying from -μ to +μ (since μ_z = |μ| cos θ)
- Continuous spread of deflections
