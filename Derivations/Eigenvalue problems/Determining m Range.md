### m Quantum Number
For a given j, m ranges in integer steps:
$$m \in \{-j, -j+1, ..., j-1, j\}$$
**Total number of states**: 2j + 1


**j = 0** (scalar):
- m = 0 only
- 1 state

**j = 1/2** (spin-1/2):
- m = -1/2, +1/2
- 2 states: |1/2, -1/2⟩ and |1/2, +1/2⟩
- Conventionally written as |-z⟩ and |+z⟩

**j = 1** (spin-1):
- m = -1, 0, +1
- 3 states

**j = 3/2**:
- m = -3/2, -1/2, +1/2, +3/2
- 4 states
