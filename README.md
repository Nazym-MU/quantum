## Quantum Mechanics Notes
These are my personal notes from an undergraduate Quantum Mechanics course, organized in Obsidian.

### Structure
The vault is organized into the following main folders:

- **Concepts/**: Core ideas and definitions
- **Topics/**: Broader subject areas connecting multiple concepts
- **Experiments/:** Notes on experimeents, such as the Stern-Gerlach experiments
- **Derivations and Details/:** Step-by-step mathematical derivations linked to concepts
- **Formulas/:** Key equations linked to concepts
- **Examples/:** Worked examples and applications

## Main Topics Covered
- Stern-Gerlach experiments and spin quantization
- Matrix mechanics and basis transformations
- Angular momentum operators and eigenstates
- Commutators and uncertainty
- Time evolution and the Schr√∂dinger equation
- Constants of motion
