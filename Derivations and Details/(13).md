# Infinitesimal Time Evolution Operator

Starting from the composition property and taking infinitesimal time step:
$$\hat{U}(t + dt) = \hat{U}(dt)\hat{U}(t)$$

For small dt, expand:
$$\hat{U}(dt) = I + \text{(something proportional to dt)}$$

Must be unitary, so:
$$\hat{U}(dt) = I - \frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}dt$$

where Ĥ is Hermitian (ensuring unitarity).

This leads directly to the [[Schrödinger Equation (Time-Dependent)]].
