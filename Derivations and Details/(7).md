### Find probability of $\ket{+z}$ to be in the state $\ket{-z}$ in modified SG
Initial ket in terms of $\ket{+x}$ and $\ket{-x}$:
$$\ket{+z} = \ket{+x}\braket{+x | +z} + \ket{-x}\braket{-x | +z}$$
$$\braket{-z | +z} = \braket{-z | +x}\braket{+x | +z} + \braket{-z | -x}\braket{-x | +z}$$
Read from right to left: "amplitude for a particle with Sz = +h/2 ti have Sx = -h/2 times..."
Probability:
$$\begin{split} |\braket{-z | +z}|^2 =\;& |\braket{-z | +x}|^2 |\braket{+x | +z}|^2 + \\ & + |\braket{-z | -x}|^2 |\braket{-x | +z}|^2 + \\ & + \braket{-z | +x}\braket{+x | +z} \braket{-z | -x}^*\braket{-x | +z}^* + \\ & + \braket{-z | +x}^*\braket{+x | +z}^* \braket{-z | -x}\braket{-x | +z} \end{split}$$
- The first and second term sum to $\frac{1}{2} -$ what we get when we make a measurement of Sx
- The third and fourth terms (interference terms) are there because we didn't measure
	- We added the amplitudes before squaring them
