## Aspect et al. (1982)
**Setup:** Polarization-entangled photon pairs from atomic cascade
**Result:** Violated Bell's inequality by **9 standard deviations**
**Innovation:** Switched detector orientations *while photons in flight* to eliminate loopholes where devices could "know" each other's settings

## Kwiat et al. (1999)
**Setup:** Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)
Single photon â†’ pair of entangled photons in nonlinear crystal
**Result:** Violated Bell's inequality by **242 standard deviations** in only 3 minutes
**Significance:** Much faster, cleaner violation. Technology now mature.
