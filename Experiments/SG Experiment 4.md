![[SG experiment 4 drawing.png]]
- Modified SG device [[(3)]]
- z-basis representation - what this device does generally - blocking the lower path:
	- $\hat{P}_+\ket{+z} = \ket{+z}\bra{+z}\ket{+z} = \ket{+z}$ - eigenstate with an eigenvalue 1
	- $\hat{P}_+\ket{-z} = \ket{+z}\bra{+z}\ket{-z} = 0$ - eigenstate with an eigenvalue 0
- x-basis representation - to find probabilities of specific outcomes
	- Uses [[Identity operator]]
	- Different probability calculation: with vs. without making a measurement [[(7)]]
## Conclusion
---
With an unmeasured SGx in the middle, all particles exit the final SGz in |+zâŸ©.

> When we don't (!) make measurements in the modified SG, add probability amplitudes (not probabilities) and "square".
