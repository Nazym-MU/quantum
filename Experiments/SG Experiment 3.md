![[SG experiment 3 drawing.png]]
- Particles going thorugh SGx modified the state
- Sz and Sx cannot be observed at the same time
---
- Particle has nonzero amplitudes c+ and c- to be in states |+z⟩ and |-z⟩ (in a superposition of states):
$$\ket{\psi} = c_+ \ket{+z}+ c_- \ket{-z}$$
$$\bra{\psi} = c_+' \bra{+z}+ c_-' \bra{-z}$$
- |ψ⟩ - arbitrary spin state
- c+ and c- <- complex coefficients
---
General solution for c+ and c-:
$$c_+ = \frac{e^{i\delta_+}}{\sqrt{2}} \text{ and } c_- = \frac{e^{i\delta_-}}{\sqrt{2}}$$
[[Expectation Values]] and [[Uncertainty]]:
$$\braket{S_z^2} = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} \text{ and } \Delta S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \text{ for a single particle in the state } \ket{+x}$$
