## Finding
---
Intrinsic spin angular momentum takes only two values: +ℏ/2 and -ℏ/2.
## Setup
---
Collimated beam of silver atoms is directed between the poles (one flat, one with a sharp tip [[SG Deflection Direction]] to produce inhomogeneous magnetic field) of a magnet. 
$$\mu = \frac{gq}{2mc}S$$ [[<1>]]
- #g_constant - dimensionless
- #mu - [[Magnetic Moment]]
- #S - Intrinsic spin angular momentum
---
Atoms get deflected to only two positions instead of a classical continuous spread [[Force on Magnetic Moment in Field]].
