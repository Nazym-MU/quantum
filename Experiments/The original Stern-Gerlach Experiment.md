## Finding
---
Intrinsic spin angular momentum takes only two values: +ℏ/2 and -ℏ/2.
## Setup
---
Collimated beam of silver atoms is directed between the poles (one flat, one with a sharp tip [[(1)]] to produce inhomogeneous magnetic field) of a magnet. 
$$\mu = \frac{gq}{2mc}S$$ [[<1>]]
- #g_constant - dimensionless
- #mu - [[Magnetic moment]]
- #S - [[Intrinsic spin angular momentum]]
## Result
---
Atoms get deflected to only two positions instead of a classical continuous spread [[(2)]]. 
## Key Concepts
---
- Classical physics #analog: [[Angular momentum - magnetic moment (classical physics)]]
- [[Reduced Planck constant (ℏ)]]
