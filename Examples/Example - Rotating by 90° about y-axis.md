Rotation operator: $\hat{R}(\frac{\pi}{2}\hat{j})$
### Active
Start with |ψ⟩ in S_z basis, create new rotated state:
$$|\psi'\rangle = \hat{R}^\dagger\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\hat{j}\right)|\psi\rangle$$
**Result**: Physical state has been rotated
- |+z⟩ → |+x⟩ (spin now points in x-direction)
### Passive
Same |ψ⟩, but now express it in S_x basis instead of S_z basis:
$$|\psi\rangle \xrightarrow[S_x\text{ basis}]{} \begin{pmatrix} \langle+x|\psi\rangle \\ \langle-x|\psi\rangle \end{pmatrix}$$
**Result**: Different representation of same state
- Changed from S_z coordinates to S_x coordinates
