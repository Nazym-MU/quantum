- Commutator of two operations: $[\hat{A}, \hat{B}] = \hat{A}\hat{B} - \hat{B}\hat{A}$
- Operators commute when commutators are zero
	- Can be diagonalized simultaneously
	- There exist eigenvectors that are eigenvectors of both $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ simultaneously. They form the basis for the Hilbert space.
	- This means that they can be measured simultaneously without quantum uncertainty between them.
	- Example: $\hat{J}^2$ and $\hat{J}_z$ commute → you can find states $∣j,m⟩$ where you know both the **total angular momentum** and the **z-component** at the same time.
	- Once we choose basis of simultaneous eigenstates, both operators are diagonal in that basis.

- [[Degeneracy]] can be resolved by diagonalizing the commuting operator.
[[Angular momentum eigenstuff]]:
1. $[\hat{J}_x, \hat{J}_y]=i\hbar\hat{J}_z$
2. $[\hat{J}_y, \hat{J}_z]=i\hbar\hat{J}_x$
3. $[\hat{J}_z, \hat{J}_x]=i\hbar\hat{J}_y$
