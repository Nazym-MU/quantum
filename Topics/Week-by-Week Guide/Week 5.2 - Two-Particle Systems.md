## Basis States

For a system of two spin-1/2 particles, the natural basis consists of **direct products** of single-particle states: 
$|1\rangle = |+z, +z\rangle = |+z\rangle_1 \otimes |+z\rangle_2$
$|2\rangle = |+z, -z\rangle = |+z\rangle_1 \otimes |-z\rangle_2$
$|3\rangle = |-z, +z\rangle = |-z\rangle_1 \otimes |+z\rangle_2$
$|4\rangle = |-z, -z\rangle = |-z\rangle_1 \otimes |-z\rangle_2$
- First element: spin state of particle 1
- Second element: spin state of particle 2
- These form a **4-dimensional** basis (2 states × 2 states)
## Key Properties
### Direct Product Structure
- We can form basis states by taking products from different vector spaces
- The symbol ⊗ emphasizes this is a special type of multiplication
- Can simplify notation: $|+z\rangle_1|+z\rangle_2$ or just $|+z, +z\rangle$
### Independence of Rotation Operators
The generators of rotations for each particle commute: $$[\hat{S}_{1i}, \hat{S}_{2j}] = 0$$
This means we can rotate particle 1's spin independently of particle 2's spin.
