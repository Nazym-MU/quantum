### Entanglement as a Resource
- [[EPR Pair]] provides the "bridge" needed for quantum information transfer
- Pre-shared entanglement enables capabilities impossible with classical communication alone
### Quantum Teleportation
- [[Quantum Teleportation]] transfers an unknown quantum state from Alice to Bob
- Cannot copy states ([[No-Cloning Theorem]]), so direct measurement is impossible
- Solution: use entanglement + classical communication
### Technical Tools
- [[Bell State Measurement]] projects two particles onto the Bell basis
- All four Bell states are maximally entangled
- Each measurement outcome determines which unitary Bob must apply
## The Protocol in Brief
1. Alice and Bob share an [[EPR Pair]]
2. Alice performs a [[Bell State Measurement]] on her particle and the unknown state
3. Alice sends 2 classical bits (her measurement result) to Bob
4. Bob applies a unitary rotation to recover the original state
5. Teleportation is complete (original state destroyed)
## Why It Matters
- Illustrates "spooky action at a distance" in a practical context
- Shows entanglement enables quantum advantages over classical physics
- Foundation for quantum computing and quantum cryptography
