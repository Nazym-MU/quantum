### Angular Momentum Uncertainty (§3.5)
- [[General Uncertainty Relation from Commutators|General uncertainty relation]]: ΔA·ΔB ≥ |⟨C⟩|/2 when \[A,B\] = iC
- Application: [[Angular Momentum Component Uncertainties|ΔJₓΔJz ≥ ℏ|⟨Jy⟩|/2]]
- Why angular momentum never points in definite direction
### Energy-Time Uncertainty (§4.6)
- [[Energy-Time Uncertainty Relation]]: ΔE·Δt ≥ ℏ/2
- Δt is evolutionary timescale, not uncertainty in time measurement
- Connection to [[Stationary States]] and natural linewidth
### Position-Momentum and Double-Slit (§6.7)
- Classical limit: why quantum effects invisible macroscopically
- [[Double-Slit Experiment]]: self-interference and measurement effects
- Uncertainty principle maintains logical consistency
