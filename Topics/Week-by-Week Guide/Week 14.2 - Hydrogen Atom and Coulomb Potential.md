**Goal**: Solve the hydrogen atom completely - find energy levels and wave functions.
**What we have** (from Ch 9):
- Radial equation in 1D form
- Boundary conditions from behavior near origin
**What we do here**:
1. **Ch 10.1**: Establish boundary conditions for radial wave function ($u(0) = 0$)
2. **Ch 10.2**: Solve Coulomb potential (hydrogen atom) exactly
**Result**: Complete understanding of hydrogen spectrum, energy levels, and wave functions. This is one of the greatest successes of quantum mechanics.
