**Goal**: Find the complete wave functions for central potential problems (hydrogen atom, etc.).
**What we have so far** (from [[Week 13 - Three-Dimensional Wave Mechanics and Two-Body Problem|Ch 9.1-9.6]]):
- Reduced 3D problem to 1D radial equation using rotational symmetry
- Know states are labeled $|E, l, m\rangle$ with $\hat{L}^2$ and $\hat{L}_z$ eigenvalues
**What we need**: The actual wave functions $\langle r, \theta, \phi | E, l, m \rangle$ in position space.
1. **Ch 9.8**: Express $\hat{L}$ operators as differential operators in spherical coordinates
2. **Ch 9.9**: Solve for the angular part of wave functions (spherical harmonics)
**Why this matters**: 
- Spherical harmonics $Y_{l,m}(\theta, \phi)$ give the angular distribution of particles
- Single-valuedness requirement proves $l$ must be integer (explains why orbital ≠ spin)
- These shapes determine molecular geometry and chemical bonding
