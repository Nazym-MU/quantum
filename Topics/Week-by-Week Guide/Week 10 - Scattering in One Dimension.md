## Overview
Scattering theory examines unbound states where particles have E > V everywhere or can tunnel through barriers. Unlike bound states, energy is continuous.
### Unbound States
States where the particle is not confined to a finite region. Energy eigenvalues form a continuum rather than discrete levels. See [[Unbound States]].
### Probability Current
The flow of probability through space, ensuring local conservation of probability. See [[Probability Current]].
### Scattering Processes
- [[Reflection Coefficient]] - probability of particle bouncing back
- [[Transmission Coefficient]] - probability of particle passing through
- [[Potential Step Scattering]]
- [[Potential Barrier Scattering]]
- [[Quantum Tunneling]]
- [[Non-Square Barrier Approximation]] - WKB method for realistic barriers
### Wave Propagation
- [[Plane Wave Direction of Travel]] - understanding why e^(ikx) travels right and e^(-ikx) travels left
## Key Results
- **Probability conservation:** R + T = 1
- **Step potential (E > V₀):** Partial reflection even when classically none expected
- **Step potential (E < V₀):** Total reflection (R = 1) but wave penetrates
- **Barrier tunneling (E < V₀):** Nonzero transmission through classically forbidden region
- **Tunneling decay:** T ∝ e^(-2qa) for thick barriers
- **Threshold behavior (E = V₀):** T = 1/(1 + (ka/2)²)
