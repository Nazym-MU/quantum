- **Schrödinger Equation in Position Space**
	- Time-dependent: $i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H}\psi$
	- Time-independent: $\hat{H}\psi = E\psi$
	- Projects abstract operator equation into position basis
- **Bound States vs Scattering States**
	- Bound: E < V(∞), discrete energies, localized, normalizable
	- Scattering: E > V(∞), continuous energies, extended
- **General Solution Behavior**
	- E > V region: oscillatory, d²ψ/dx² = -k²ψ
	- E < V region: exponential, d²ψ/dx² = +q²ψ  
	- Turning point: E = V(x), inflection point
- **Boundary Conditions**
	- ψ(x) continuous everywhere (unless V = ∞)
	- dψ/dx continuous at finite potential steps
	- ψ = 0 at infinite walls
- **Finite Square Well**
	- Three regions: oscillatory inside, exponential decay outside
	- Matching ψ and dψ/dx at boundaries → discrete energies
	- Wave function penetrates into classically forbidden region
- **Infinite Square Well (Particle in a Box)**
	- V = ∞ walls → ψ = 0 at boundaries
	- Quantization: kₙa = nπ
	- Energies: Eₙ = n²π²ℏ²/(2ma²)
	- Number of nodes = n - 1
	- Exact analytical solution possible
