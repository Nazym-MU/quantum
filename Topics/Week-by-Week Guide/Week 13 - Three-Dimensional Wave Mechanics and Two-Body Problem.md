## Physical
The transition to 3D enables modeling real physical systems (atoms, molecules). The two-body problem with central potential V(|r₁ - r₂|) separates into center-of-mass motion (trivial) and relative motion (contains all interesting physics). Translational symmetry guarantees momentum conservation: physics is independent of absolute position in space.
Rotational invariance parallels translational invariance. Both are continuous symmetries leading to conservation laws via Noether's theorem.
