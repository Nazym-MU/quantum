### States as Vectors
- [[Bra-Ket Notation]] - kets as column vectors, bras as row vectors
- [[Quantum States and Amplitudes]] - coefficients cₙ = ⟨aₙ|ψ⟩
- [[Basis States and Completeness]] - orthonormal sets
### Operators as Matrices
- [[Operator Fundamentals]] - linear operators acting on states
- [[Matrix Representations]] - Aᵢⱼ = ⟨aᵢ|Â|aⱼ⟩
- [[Hermitian Operators]] - A† = A, real eigenvalues
- [[Unitary Operators]] - U†U = I, preserves normalization
### Special Operators
- [[Projection Operators]] - P̂ = |a⟩⟨a|, used for measurements
- [[Identity Operators]] - sum of projection operators
- [[Rotation Operators]] - rotates states/bases
### Matrix Operations
- [[Inner and Outer Products]] - ⟨φ|ψ⟩ vs |ψ⟩⟨φ|
- [[Adjoint Operators]] - conjugate transpose
- [[Expectation Values]] - ⟨Â⟩ as bra-matrix-ket
