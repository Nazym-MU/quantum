## Definitions
- $\hat{J}$ - vector operator composed of three operators: $\hat{J}_x$, $\hat{J}_y$, $\hat{J}_z$ - Hermitian operators corresponding to angular momentum projections on the x, y, z axes
- $\hat{J^2}$ - squared magnitude of the total angular momentum
## Properties
- Since $\hat{J}^2$ is built from sums of squared Hermitian operators, its eigenvalues must be $\geq 0$
- $J^2$ commutes with each projection [[(10)]]. Therefore, they have simultaneous eigenstates in common [[(11)]]:
	- $\hat{J^2}\ket{\lambda, m} = \lambda \hbar^2\ket{\lambda, m}$
	- $\hat{J}_z\ket{\lambda, m}=m\hbar \ket{\lambda, m}$
- $⟨ψ∣J^2∣ψ⟩≥0$: For any operator $A^\dagger A$, the expectation value is non-negative [[(12)]].
